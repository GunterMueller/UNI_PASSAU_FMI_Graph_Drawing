GraphEd 2.0 - 2.04 important changes :
======================================

- There is now a new  menubar underneath the  control window. The
  menu itself has been slightly reorganized.

- A new GraGra type 1-ENCE has been implemented. 1-ENCE is like
  1-NCE, but includes edge labels in the embedding function.

- There are some new options for graph grammar embeddings : empty
  labels may be considered as wildcards, and node/edge type and
  color may be included in the matching operation. Look at the
  'gragra defaults' menu.

- We have added many new algorithms, e.g.
  = Hopcroft-Tarjan Planarity Test (working !)
  = Spring Embedder for Layout of arbitrary graphs - with animation
  = Convex drawing of planar graphs
  = A algorithm to draw straight-line planar graphs
  = A new algorith to draw planar graphs developed by U. Schnieders
  = Termgraph, a package to draw Petri Nets from agents

- We have started to implement a On-line help feature.

- The fileselector is much faster now.

- GraphEd can now read nodetypes fro SUN mono-color rasterfiles;
  however, speed is slow for bitmaps larger than 100x100, so don't
  read in a whole screen.

- The makefile has changed; 'make all' and a following 'make install' 

- Many bugs fixed.


GraphEd 2.04 - 2.1 Changes
==========================

- New layout algorithms
  = Bends minization according to Roberto Tamassia
  = Drawing arbitrary trees

- New directory layout & makefiles

- Manz minor enhancements

- Bug fixes


Sgraph changes :
================

- Sgraph applications do now need a main program, which in turn
  must call graphed_main (argc, argv). For example :

  main(argc, argv)
  int	argc;
  char	**argv;
  {
	graphed_main (argc, argv);
  }

  init_user_menu must still be provided.

- link with graphed.o instead of -lgraphed -lsgraph -lsgraph.
  We found out that this way is more efficient than using libraries,
  especially on small, slow machines.

- Sgraph_proc_info : new parameter recenter. Set recenter = TRUE
  to recenter the graph. This feature allows you to reallocate
  coordinates and then ask GraphEd te recalibrate the graph.

Passau (trillian/zaphod/orion) :

Default Installation fuer graphed.o ist /public/graphed/lib/graphed.o
