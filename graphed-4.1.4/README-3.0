========================================================================

GraphEd is available for non-commercial use via anonymous ftp from

	forwiss.uni-passau.de (132.231.1.10) :
	/pub/local/graphed

The lastet version,  running unter X11/XView  resp.  OpenWindows,
is 3.1. This version needs PixRect, which is usually installed.

The Directories :
=================

doc/
  Manuals, a Macintosh with StuffIt (1.5.1 or greater) and MS Word
  (4.0 or greater) are needed. See doc/README for details.

sunview/
  Old Sunview code, binaries included. Will disappear soon.

binaries/
  GraphEd binaries for SUN4 (SunOs 4.1.1)

sgraph-standalone/
  Standalone algorithms, mainly for use as submodules in other programs.
  Available are
  - HT planarity test
  - springembedder layout algorithm
  - sugiyama dag layout algorithm
  The latter two need sgraph-standalone.shar.Z. All algorithms read a
  Graph from stdin and write to stdout. The Graph must be in GraphEd
  format.


Frequently asked questions / problems
=====================================

- Requirements :
  - SunOS 4.1.*
  - X11 + XView 3.0 or
  - OpenWindows 3.0
  GraphEd can run on plain  X11, Display PostScript is NOT  needed.
  olwm is currently  not needed (but fits nicer).


- Possible Installation Problems :
  - /usr/bin/cc is sufficent.
  - gcc -traditional might work, but is not fully tested.
  - GraphEd does reportedly *NOT* compile with GNU make.
  - GraphEd does not compile with OpenWin 2.0. The binaries seem to work.
  - if GraphEd cannot find ".graphed", you probably forgot to
    do a "make install"


- Solaris
  We do not have Solaris 2.*, so I cannot say anything about that topic.
  However, I do not expect major problems, and the binary seems to run.

- Plans :
  - full conversion to X11 graphics
  - more algorithms, esp. layout and graph grammar parser
  - finding a maximum planar subgraph, application to layout
  - updated manuals (printed and on-line ones)
  - more Sgraph features (esp. ability to work with more than one graph)
  - dynamic libraries


- Known Bugs :
  - Sometimes, the user interface hangs.
  - The on-line manual needs updates, als well as the printed manual.
  - The "layout suite" distributed with this version is under development
    and not fully tested.
  - We are interested in getting bug reports.
