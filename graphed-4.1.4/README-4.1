This README describes the first official ANSI version of GraphEd.

Changes to the original GraphEd 4.0.21 version for Sun-OS:

   * GraphEd was converted to ANSI-C.
   * Support for Sun OS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.4 and Linux
   * Tunkelang layout included


We built GraphEd succesfully under the following conditions:

++ Sun-OS 4.1.3: 

   * compiler: gcc -ansi (GNU gcc Version 2.6.2)
   * lex, yacc and make used from Sun-OS
   * flex and bison instead of lex and yacc, GNU make supported


++ Solaris 2.4: cc (Solaris CC Version 3.0)

   * compiler: cc (Solaris CC Version 3.0) or gcc (Version 2.6.3, no -ansi!)
   * lex, yacc and make used from Solaris 2.4 (in /usr/ccs/bin!!)
   * flex and bison, GNU make supported

++ Linux:

   * gcc 2.5.8, libc 4.5.8, Kernel 1.1.93


Compiling for Solaris 2.4 (also Solaris 2)
==========================================

Take a look at makefile.template, whether the path to make is ok
(entry MAKE at the top of makefile.template). Then just say make :-)

If you prefer GNU make, take a look at contrib/makefile.template


Compiling for SUN-OS 4.1.x (also Solaris 1)
===========================================

This version is shipped ready for compilining on a Solaris 2.x host.
For compiling on a Solaris 1 (or SUN-OS 4.1.x) you have to take the
following changes:

makefile.template:
    MAKE=<where is your make>/make
    ARCH=SunOS                     for libs, includes, ...
    CC=gcc -ansi


Common Problems:
================

FIRST: Take a look at makefile.template and contrib/makefile.template!!

Do not use gcc -ansi with Solaris.

For changing from SUN make to GNU make, you have to change a line
in contrib/makefile.template (it is commented there)

If you work with external modules (i.e. link your modules to graphed.o)
you should work with -DEXTERNAL_LINK_MODULE for compiling your module.

Please send any bugs you find to: graphed@fmi.uni-passau.de

Thank you very much.
