@item
A new implementation of Tamassia's bends minimization algorithm is
included ("planar / bends minization 2", Bettina Rimmel, Max Eidenschink).

This one is for undirected graphs only, but it uses the HT planarity test
and therefore it does not need a planar drawing to start with. It is also
much faster than the previous implementation.  The assignment of
coordinates is not as nice as before, but that can be solved by running
both versions in sequence.

@item
Sgraph bug fixed, destructor functions are now handled correctly

@item
Another bug in the PostScript driver fixed

@item
We do not raise the "Ed" in GraphEd anymore, since several people
have problems with that, especially those who use TeX.

@item
Several new documents have been put to the "paper" subdirectory.

more annoying XView warnings if capacity is full.
