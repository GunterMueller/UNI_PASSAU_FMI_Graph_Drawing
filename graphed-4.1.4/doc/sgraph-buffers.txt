Sgraph buffer Interface
=======================

A buffer is a list of of graphs, usually corresponding to a window.
Buffers are designated via an index. Additionally, each buffer has a
(unique) name.

void	buffer_set_filename (buffer, filename)
int	buffer;
char	*filename;

filename may not be NULL and should be unique.


char	*buffer_get_filename (buffer)
int	buffer;

Caution : may be NULL or "".


int	buffer_is_unused (buffer)
int	buffer;

A unused buffer is not displayed and does *not* contain any valid data.


int	find_buffer_by_name (name)
char	*name;

Search for a buffer with that name. Returns (-1) if none found.


int	get_buffer_by_name (name)
char	*name;

Search for a buffer with that name. If  none exists, create a new
one.  Returns (-1) if none found. This is the usual procedure for
an application to create a new buffer.


Temporary Buffers
----------------------------------

If the name of a  buffer starts with  a dash '-',  that buffer is
considered temporary. When the window s  closed, GraphEd will not
ask the user whether the contents should be saved.
