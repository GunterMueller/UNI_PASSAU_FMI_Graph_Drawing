Extension methods and extension classes for third-party code including
the jdk.
<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dxm5z6n_143hpcptw">Extension
methods</a>
were (amongst others) proposed by Google as a java language improvement.
An extension method is a static method whose first argument is an
explicit this-pointer to the object whose class's interface is to be
extended. With proper language support its possible to call a method
such as
<pre>
public static void foo(Bar this_,...)
</pre>
like this:
<pre>
Bar bar = ...;
bar.foo(...);
</pre>
An extension class does the same thing by subclassing an existing class
and adding methods to the interface.
