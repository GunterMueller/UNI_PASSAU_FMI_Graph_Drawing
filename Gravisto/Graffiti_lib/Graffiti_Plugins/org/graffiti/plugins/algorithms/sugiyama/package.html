<h3><a name="introduction">1. Introduction</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This package contains general classes for the sugiyama-framework. This documentation
is intended for a user, who wants to run the sugiyama-algorithm on a graph. If 
you are a programmer and want to implement an algorithm for a phase in the
sugiyama-algorithm, please refer to the documentation in the respective package.
You will find detailled introductions on how to write an algorithm for each phase
there.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The sugiyama-algorithm paints a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) using four phases.
The input-graph does not have to be acyclic. If it does contain one or more
cycles, the first phase (decycling) will manipulate the edges in the graph to
remove all cycles.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This package contains the main algorithm: <b>Sugiyama</b> and a helper-plugin:
<b>SugiyamaAttributesCreator</b>. The plugin "SugiyamaAttributesCreator" adds
attributes to a graph that are needed for the sugiyama-algorithm. The plugin
can also add relative x-positions or levels to a give graph if you want to
test implementations on a user-defined graph.
</p>
<p align="justify">The package <b>utils</b> contains various helper-classes for the algorithm,
that you can and should use when writing new algorithms. The most important
one is <tt>SugiyamaData</tt>. You might have to put specific data in this bean
when implementing a certain phase. Please refer to the documentation in the
corresponding package for the values that are expected from algorithms in a
later phase.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The sugiyama-algorithm itself can be described in the following way.
</p>

<h3><a name="four_phases">2. The four phases of the sugiyama-algorithm</a></h3>
<h4>The first phase - decycling</h4>
<p align="justify">
The decycling-phase manipulates edges in the graph to break all the cycles it
contains. The package <b>decycling</b> contains algorithms and tools to decycle
a graph. Please refer to the documentation of the decycling-package for further
information.
</p>
<h4>The second phase - levelling</h4>
<p align="justify">
The levelling-phase assigns a level or layer to each node in the graph. In this
phase, it is important that edges only point from level i to level i+1. They
must not point to a node on the same level as the source or to a node on a 
level above the current node.
</p>
When the source of an edge is located on level i and its target on level j,
where j > i + 1, dummy-nodes have to be inserted on each level between the
source-node and the target-node. The <b>levelling</b>-package contains 
algorithms and tools for the second phase of the sugiyama-algorithm. Please
refer to the documentation of the levelling-package for further information.
</p>
<h4>The third phase - cross-minimization</h4>
<p align="justify">The third phase tries to minimize the number of edges that cross each other.
The default algorithms of the framework work on a "local" basis. The only
manipulate level i and i+1, by changing the order of the nodes on one level.
They don't try to minimize the crossings on a global basis.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The package <b>crossmin</b> contains basic algorithms and tools for the third
phase. Please refer to the documentation of the crossmin-package for further
details.
</p>
<h4>The fourth phase - layout</h4>
<p align="justify">
After the first three phases, the graph is acyclic and each node has a relative
x- and y-coordinate. The fourth phase translates these relative coordinates to
"real", absolute x- and y-coordinates.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The package <b>layout</b> currently contains two wrappers for two different
implementations of the <i>Brandes-K&ouml;pf-Algorithm</i>. Please refer to the
documentation of the layout-package for further information.
</p>

<h3><a name="sugiyama">3. The plugin "Sugiyama"</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
If you want to run the sugiyama-algorithm on a graph, your graph has to have
the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your graph must at least contain one node</li>
<li>Your graph has to be directed</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
You can load your graph into gravisto and launch the sugiyama-plugin. The
algorithm has to be configured in two steps.<br>
In the first step, you can select an algorithm for each phase from a list. If
this is the first time that you run the plugin, you should push the 
"Search"-button on the first page of the configuration-dialog, to search for
more algorithms for each phase.<br>
After your have selected the algorithms for each phase, you can click on the
"Next"-button the configure each algorithm and the framework itself in detail.<br>
If you active animation-support, the algorithm will pause after each phase and
you can take a closer look at the work that the current phase has done.<br>
Some phase-algorithms have support for animations, too. If you activate their
animation-support, you can take a closer on how the algorithm affects your graph.
</p>
<p align="justify">
If you've added constraints to your graph, the framework will check these
constraints after all four phases are completed. If the algorithms were unable
to satisfy your constraints, you will receive a message with a list of constraints
that are not satisfied.
</p>

<h3><a name="tech">4. Technical details for this package</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
If you are a programmer and want to write an algorithm for a phase, you won't
have to worry about this package in most cases. You can take a closer look at
the documentation of the respective package. Nevertheless, the following
classes are important to you.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This package contains a special exception, the <b>PhasePreconditionException</b>.
It extends Gravisto's <i>PreconditionException</i>. If you implement an algorithm,
your check()-method should throw a PhasePreconditionException in favour of an
ordinary PreconditionException.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The main plugin, <b>Sugiyama</b>, controls the phase-algorithms. It implements
the <i>EditorAlgorithm</i>-Interface, because it needs a special configuration-dialog
to select and configure the algorithms.<br>
When being instanciated, <i>Sugiyama</i> loads preferences through Java's 
preferences-implementation. If your algorithm should be able to save and load
preferences from the filesystem, you have to work on the class <b>PreferencesUtil</b>
to make it aware of your algorithm.<br>
When you start <i>Sugiyama</i>, its custom configuration-dialog -
<b>AlgorithmConfigurationDialog</b> appears. This dialog saves the selected
algorithms in a <b>SugiyamaData</b>-bean, and calls <i>setParameters()</i> on
each of the selected algorithms, to save the parameters that the user entered.
This cannot be done in <i>Sugiyama</i>, because it doesn't know which algorithms
the user is going to select.
</p>
<p align="justify">
When you run <i>Sugiyama</i>, its <i>check()</i>-method is called. It does
only check if the graph is not <tt>null</tt> and does at least contain one
node. After that, it calls <i>check()</i> from the implementation of the
first phase.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Sugiyama's <i>execute()</i> works the following way:<br>
At first, the sugiyama <i>HashMapAttribute</i> is added to all the nodes, so
your algorithm does not have to worry about this attribute not being on one of
the nodes.<br>
After that, the framework <b>removes all bends from the edges</b>. If your graph
does contain bends in edges, they will be lost!<br>
After removing the bends, dummy-nodes are "collected". If you launch <i>Sugiyama</i>
on a graph and marked some of the nodes as dummy-nodes, <i>Sugiyama</i> has to
collect these nodes and put them into a data-structure in the bean <b>SugiyamaData</b>,
so all algorithms can easily access the dummy-nodes.<br>
After this step, <b>constraints are built</b> from the attributes on the nodes.
Read the section on constraints in this documentation if you want to learn more
about how to add constraints to a graph.<br>
If the user selected animation-support, <i>execute()</i> will now return and
Gravisto will request an <i>Animation</i>-Object from <i>Sugiyama</i>. It
returns a <b>SugiyamaAnimation</b>, which handles the individual phases.<br>
If you didn't turn on animation-support, <i>Sugiyama</i> will iterate over the
four phase-algorithms. It'll call their <i>check()</i>-method and <i>execute()</i>
after that.<br>
After phase two and three, the graph is updated by the framework, so the user
can monitor the progress of the phases.<br>
When all phases have been executed, the framework will collect a 
<b>CoordinateAttribute</b> in sugiyama's attribute-tree from each node and
set the "real" coordinates-attribute in the graphics-tree to the one it found
on the node. The fourth phase should only write a <i>CoordinateAttribute</i> to
the sugiyama attribute-tree, so it doesn't have to worry about changes in the
graphics-tree.<br>
Now, the dummy-nodes get removed from the graph, and bends are added instead of
them (this will make the first edge - which is the original edge in the graph -
"grow" to its original target, so your original edge is <b>not lost</b>).<br>
The decycling-phase may have reversed or even deleted edges from the graph. 
<i>Sugiyama</i> now calls the method <i>undo()</i> from the decycling-algorithm.
If you implement a decycling-algorithm, you have to make sure, that you reverse
or add the edges again. The framework provides a helper-class for that: 
<b>EdgeUtil</b>. You can call its method <i>reverseBendedEdge()</i> and the
utility will take care of reversing edges that contain bends (you have to invert
the list of bends if you reverse an edge that contains bends!).<br>
The last thing to do, is to check if all constraints are satisfied. A constraint
has to implement a method <i>check()</i>, because the constraints know best
if they are satisfied or not. If the algorithms were unable to satisfy all
constraints, a message is displayed to the user.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The program-flow in case of animation-support is identical to the flow without
animations.
</p>

<h3><a name="attributescreator">5. The plugin "SugiyamaAttributesCreator" and
user-defined constraints</a></h3>
<h3><a name="attributescreator_general">5.1 General usage</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
If you want to test implementations on a user-defined graph, the plugin
<i>SugiyamaAttributesCreator</i> can help you to easily add the attributes
Sugiyama needs to process your graph.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The plugin adds a new <i>HashMapAttribute</i> with the name "sugiyama" to
the root of the attribute-tree of each node. In this <i>HashMapAttribute</i>,
another <i>HashMapAttribute</i> is created, the <b>constraints</b>-attribute. 
If you want to add constraints to your graph (i.e. you want node a to be left of
node b), you have to add them to this attribute. More on constraints can be
found later on in this section.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The next attribute that is added to each node is the attribute <i>identifier</i>
in the sugiyama-attribute-tree. The plugin "names" each node, so that it can
be identified in the further process of the algorithm. The identifier is important,
if you want to add constraints to your graph.
</p>
<h3><a name="attributescreator_constraints">5.2 Constraints</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
Constraints are important, if you want to keep a certain sub-layout in the graph,
for example if you want node a to be located left of node b, or if you want two
nodes to have the same x-coordinates. The plugin can assist you on adding these
constraints to the nodes in the graph.
</p>
<p align="justify">
After running the plugin once on your graph, each node in the graph has a unique
identifier, the <i>StringAttribute</i> with the name <i>identifier</i> in the
sugiyama attribute-tree and an HashMapAttribute called <i>constraints</i>. You
can put your constraints in this HashMapAttribute, by inserting a new 
StringAttribute in the HashMap. Your new StringAttribute, that represents a
constraint, should have a unique name in the nodes constraints-HashMap. The
name of the constraint <b>has to start</b> with "sugiyamaConstraint", followed
by an arbitrary integer of your choice. As an example, we want to add the
following constraint to the node with the identifier "sugiyamaNode0":
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
I want sugiyamaNode0 to be left of sugiyamaNode3
</div>
We now add a new StringAttribute with the name "sugiyamaConstraint0" to
the node "sugiyamaNode0". sugiyamaNode0 is now the "source" of the constraint,
"sugiyamaNode3" will be the "target". Adding the constraint to the source is
sufficient. A constraint can be described the following way:
</p>
<p align="justify">
The beginning of the string specifies the type of constraint (e.g. horizontal
or vertical, one nodes participate in the constraint or two). You have to take
a look at the documentation in the constraints-package to learn how to describe
the constraints implemented in the sugiyama-framework. In this example, the
constraint is a horizontal constraint with two participating nodes. The implementing
class <i>HorizontalConstraintWithTwoNodes</i> needs to find the following
String in the constraint to feel responsible for the constraint:
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
HORIZONTAL_TWO_NODES_
</div>
But a horizontal constraint could have different meanings, you may want to put
node a left of node b, right of node b, or at the same position as node b. So
you have to specify how you want to put the nodes. In our example, we want 
node sugiyamaNode0 to be left of sugiyamaNode3. So we have to add
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
LEFT_OF_
</div>
to the constraint. Now, <i>HorizontalConstraintWithTwoNodes</i> knows what
you meant. It knows that you want to put sugiyamaNode0 left of some other
node. We have to add the identifier of the target-node to the constraint, aswell:
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
sugiyamaNode3
</div>
We now have a complete description of a <i>HorizontalConstraintWithTwoNodes</i>, 
the String-representation on the source-node is:
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
HORIZONTAL_TWO_NODES_LEFT_OF_sugiyamaNode3
</div>
The sugiyama-algorithm will look at StringAttributes in each node's 
constraint-HashMap and ask all known constraints if they know how to interprete
the StringAttribute. In our case, <i>HorizontalConstraintWithTwoNodes</i>
feels responsible for this string, and the sugiyama-framework can try not to
violate your constraint.<br>
At the moment, our constraint is interpreted as "I'd like to have sugiyamaNode0
left of sugiyamaNode3". It would be nice to have the graph painted that way, but
we can live with sugiyamaNode0 <b>not</b> being left of sugiyamaNode3.<br>
If we add the String "MANDATORY_" to the constraint, we tell the sugiyama-algorithm
that the painting of the graph is not usable for us if sugiyamaNode0 is not
left of sugiyamaNode3:
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
HORIZONTAL_TWO_NODES_MANDATORY_LEFT_OF_sugiyamaNode3
</div>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Further information about available constraints and how to describe them can
be found in the package <b>constraints</b>. Please note that not all algorithms
of the sugiyama-framework can handle constraints. In fact, the default 
algorithms DFSDecycling, LongestPath, BaryCenter and SocialBrandesKoepf will
not care about your constraints at all.
</p>
<h3><a name="attributescreator_other">5.3 Other attributes: xpos, level, dummy-nodes</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
If you want to test individual phases, the algorithm that implements this phase
expects that the previous phase-algorithms have already done their work. If you
want to test phase 3, you can select the dummy-algorithms for phase 1 and 2. They
will only check if phase 3 can handle your input-graph. Phase 3 (crossmin) expects
that the nodes already have been assigned to a level. You have to add an
<i>IntegerAttribute</i> with the name "level" to sugiyama's attribute-tree. The
AttributesCreator-plugin can help you to add these attributes.
</p>
<p align="justify">
You can configure the plugin to add the following attributes to a selection
of nodes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>x-pos</li>
<li>level</li>
<li>dummy-node</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
You can select multiple nodes that you want to place on the same level. Select
the nodes in Gravisto and launch the AttributesCreator-plugin.<br>
Select "Add the level-attributes to the selected nodes" in the configuration-dialog
and enter the level you want the nodes to be put in the input-field below.<br>
When you hit the run-button, the plugin will add the level to your selection.
</p>
<p align="justify">
If you select multiple nodes and want to add the x-pos-attribute to them,
select "Add the xpos-attribute to the selected nodes". There is an input-field
below. You can enter an integer in this field and each node of your selection
will get an xpos assigned starting with the number you entered in this field.<br>
If you just leave the value to "0", the first node in your selection will get
the xpos 0, the next one 1, and so on.<br>
The order in which the nodes receive this x-pos depend on the order of your selection!
If you select node a first, then node b and node c after that, node a will
get the xpos 0, node b 1 and node c 2.
</p>
<p align="justify">
If you select "Mark the selected nodes as dummy-nodes", each node will get
a BooleanAttribute with the name <i>isDummyNode</i> in its sugiyama attribute-tree.
Please remember, that a dummy-node has to have in-degree 1 and out-degree 1.
