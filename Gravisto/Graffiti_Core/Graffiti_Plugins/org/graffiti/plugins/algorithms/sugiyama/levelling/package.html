<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="justify">
This package contains algorithms for the second phase of the sugiyama-algorithm:
the levelling-phaes. In this phase, the nodes have to be put on levels or layers.<br>
Your implementation has to make sure, that the following conditions are satisfied
for each node and each edge in the graph
(Let A be the source-node of the edge, B the target-node of the edge):
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>When A is on level i, B has to be on level i+1</b>.<br>
An edge must not point
"upwards", i.e. to an upper level, it must not connect two nodes that are on the
same level. Additionally, the edges must not span over more than one level</li>
<li>You have to save the levels in the object <i>NodeLayers</i> in <i>SugiyamaData</i>.
You don't have to worry about the order of an individual layer, the next phase
will take care of that</li>
<li>There should not be an empty level in the graph</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
When you have an edge that connects Node A on level i and Node B on level j,
where j > i+1, you have to divide the edge into multiple edges. On each layer,
you have to insert a dummy-node.
</p>
<h3>The interface LevellingAlgorithm</h3>
<p align="justify">
Your algorithm has to implement the interface <i>LevellingAlgorithm</i> to be
detected as a levelling-algorithm. You have to implement the following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Getter/Setter for SugiyamaData</b></li>
<li><b>check()</b>: Check if your algorithm can handle the current layout of the
graph</li>
<li><b>execute()</b>: Compute a levelling of the graph in this method. Save your
levelling in <i>NodeLayers</i> in <i>SugiyamaData</i>.</li>
<li><b>setDefaultParameters()</b>: Reset the parameters of your algorithm to
its default state.</li>
<li><b>reset()</b>: Reset the internal state of your algorithm</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional</h3>
<p align="justify">
If it does make any sense for your algorithm, you can add support for animations.
If you do add support for animations, the framework will request an animation-object
from your implementation instead of calling execute().<br>
Please refer to the documentation of animations for further information.
</p>
<h3>The abstract class AbstractLevellingAlgorithm</h3>
<p align="justify">
The framework provides a method to add dummy-nodes to the graph. If you extend
<i>AbstractLevellingAlgorithm</i>, you can call the method <i>addDummies</i>
with a reference to <i>SugiyamaData</i>. This method will insert dummy-nodes for
you by looking through <i>NodeLayers</i> in <i>SugiyamaData</i>.
