<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="justify">
This package contains implementations of constraints in a graph. A <b>constraint</b>
represents the user's wish to draw parts of the graph the way he defined. For
example, the user may want to place one node left of another node. This would
be a constraint with two participating nodes.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Each algorithm in the four phases should try to satisfy these user-defined
constraints, otherwise the resulting picture of the graph may be unusable for
the user.
</p>
<h3>The interface SugiyamaConstraint</h3>
<p align="justify">
Each constraint has to implement the Interface <i>SugiyamaConstraint</i>, which
includes the following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>isMandatory()</b>: Constraints can be mandatory (they <b>must</b> be
satisfied) or not. This method has to return <tt>true</tt>, if the constraint
is a mandatory constraint, <tt>false</tt> otherwise.</li>
<li><b>setMandatory()</b>: Setter for the attribute <i>mandatory</i>.</li>
<li><b>check()</b>: Each constraint has to implement this method. In this method,
it has to check, if the algorithms in the four phases had been able to satisfy
the constraint. You have to access all participating nodes in the graph and
analyze their layout. If the constraint is satisfied, you have to return
<tt>true</tt> here, otherwise <tt>false</tt>.</li>
<li><b>isConstraint()</b>: The user adds constraints to a graph by adding a
textual representation of a constraint to a node, edge, or to the graph itself.
The framework will collect all these strings and pass them to all knowing
implementations of <i>SugiyamaConstraint</i>. If the string describes your
constraint, you have to return a new constraint-object. If it doesn't, return
<tt>null</tt> here.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accessing constraints</h3>
<p align="justify">
If the algorithm that you implement is constraint-aware, you can access all
constraints through <i>SugiyamaData</i>. The framework will collect all
constraints in its initialization-phase and put them into a HashSet in
SugiyamaData. You can call SugiyamaData's <i>getConstraints()</i>-method to
access this HashSet.
</p>
<h3>Default constraints</h3>
<p align="justify">
The framework comes with two default constraints: <i>HorizontalConstraintWithTwoNodes</i>
and <i>VerticalConstraintWithTwoNodes</i>. These constraint describe how the
two participating nodes should be placed in the graph. A <i>HorizontalConstraintWithTwoNodes</i>
describes how the two nodes should be put relative to each other from a
horizontal point of view. One node could be placed left of the other node,
right of it, or at the same horizontal position.
</p>
<h3>Using constraints</h3>
<p align="justify">
If you want to add a constraint to a node, you have to access its 
constraint-HashMapAttribute in the sugiyama attribute-tree. You have to add a
new <i>StringAttribute</i> into this HashMap. The name of the attribute should
start with "sugiyamaConstraint", followed by an arbitrary, not already chosen
integer. You have to take a look at the javadoc of the implementing constraints
to learn how to describe such a constraint. An example can also be found in
the documentation of the sugiyama-package.
