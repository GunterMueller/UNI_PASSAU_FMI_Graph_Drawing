  Contains an implementation of the extended Reingold-Tilford algorithm which
  hierarchically lays out a rooted tree of unbounded degree and with arbitrary
  node sizes.

<p>
  Throughout this package, the terms 'width' and 'height' of (sub)trees refer to
  dimensions of the tree layout rather than graph-theoretic properties.
