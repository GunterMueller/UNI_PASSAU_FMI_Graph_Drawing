<p>This package contains classes for an abstract representation of the
content read in from a file in the <a
href="http://www.infosun.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/"
target="_new">Graph Modelling Language (GML)</a>. The parser will return
an instance of <code>GML</code> for a read in file. This object can then
be transformed into another representation.
