<h3>Description</h3>
<p align=justify">
The sugiyama-plugin implements the interface <i>EditorAlgorithm</i> and has to
supply its own ParameterDialog. This has to be done because of limitations in
the default ParameterDialog of Gravisto.<br>
Sugiyama is configured in two steps: In the first step (the first page of the
dialog), the user has to select an algorithm for each phase. The dialog includes
a search-button that lets the user search for additional algorithms that can be
found somewhere in his classpath.<br>
The utility-class <b>FindPhaseAlgorithms</b> is used to discover algorithms in
the classpath. The available algorithms are stored into <i>SugiyamaData</i> and
additionally into the filesystem through Java.Preferences, so the user does not
have to search the entire classpath for algorithms each time he starts Gravisto.<br>
Preferences-handling is done in the utility-class <b>PreferencesUtil</b> in the
util-package.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The selected algorithms in the first page of the dialog cannot be passed to
Sugiyama directly, but have to be stored into <i>SugiyamaData</i>. If the user
clicks the next-button, all components in the dialog are removed and for each
of the algorithms, a new ParameterEditPanel is added to the dialog. The dialog
itself cannot be disposed and replaced with another one due to limitations in
Gravisto.
</p>
<p align="justified">
The selected algorithms are stored into <i>SugiyamaData</i>, their configuration
is stored through <i>setParameters()</i>. Sugiyama itself does not have to worry
which algorithms had been selected or how they had been configured. All this
information is stored in <i>SugiyamaData</i> or the correspondig algorithm.
