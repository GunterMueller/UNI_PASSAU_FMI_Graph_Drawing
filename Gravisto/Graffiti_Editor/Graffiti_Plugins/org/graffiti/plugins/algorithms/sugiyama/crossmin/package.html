<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="justify">
This package contains algorithms for the crossmin-phase of the sugiyama-algorithm.
Each algorithm in this package <b>has to implement the interface CrossMinAlgorithm</b>.
</p>
<h3>The interface CrossMinAlgorithm</h3>
<p align="justify">
Your algorithm has to implement the interface <i>CrossMinAlgorithm</i> to be
detected as an algorithm that implements the third phase of the sugiyama-algorithm.<br>
If your algorithm doesn't minimize the crossings on a global basis, it is a good
idea to extend the provided class <i>AbstractLocalCrossMinAlgorithm</i>. If you
don't want to extend <i>AbstractLocalCrossMinAlgorithm</i>, your should extend
<i>AbstractAlgorithm</i> instead!
</p>
<p align="justify">
You have access to <i>NodeLayers</i> of <i>SugiyamaData</i>. The previous phase
computes a levelling of the graph and saves it in <i>NodeLayers</i>, so you don't
have to access node-attributes to figure out on which level or layer they are on.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The order of the nodes on each ArrayList inside <i>NodeLayers</i> implies the 
x-coordinate that you have assigned to the node. You don't have to add any 
additional attributes to the node.
</p>
<h3>The abstract class AbstractLocalCrossMinAlgorithm</h3>
<p align="justify">
Most of the algorithms in this phase try to minimize edge-crossings by manipulating
two consecutive levels of the graph. One level is considered fixed, the nodes on
the level next to it are permutated to reduce the number of crossings between
these two layers; this is done top-down and bottom-up.<br>
The class <i>AbstractLocalCrossMinAlgorithm</i> provides a solid basis if you 
want to implement such an algorithm. If you extend this class, you have to
implement the following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>check()</b>: Check if your algorithm can handle the current layout of the
graph</li>
<li><b>getName()</b>: You have to return the name of your algorithm here; it will
be displayed in the algorithm-chooser.</li>
<li><b>initialize()</b>: Most algorithms in this phase have to perform some kind
of inizialization, for example write attributes on all the nodes on the first
level (there's no level above and you start to consider it fixed in the first
iteration).</li>
<li><b>processLayers()</b>: This is the most important method of your algorithm.
In this method, you have to minimize the crossings of two levels. The number of
the layer/level that has to be processed, the "direction" (top-down/bottom-up)
and an object of the type <i>NodeLayers</i> is passed to this method. You can
access <i>NodeLayers</i> to access the needed layers in the graph and start
permutating nodes on the level that is considered fixed. <i>NodeLayers</i> is
created in the levelling-phase (phase two), you should not change the level
of the nodes.
<br>
You don't have to worry about the total number of iterations, the abstract
implementation will take care of that.</li>
<li><b>reset():</b> Reset the internal state of your algorithm here</li>
<li><b>setDefaultParameters():</b> Set the parameters of your algorithm to its
default state</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
The abstract implementation provides support for sub-animations. When this is
turned on by the user, each top-down- and bottom-up-iteration is considered
one step of the animation.<br>
If your algorithm provides additional parameters, you should take care of the
parameter that toggles animation-support. Your algorithm will inherit the 
boolean <i>animated</i> from the abstract implementation. This boolean acts as
a switch for animation-support.<br>
An implementation of this abstract class can be found in the BaryCenter-algorithm.
