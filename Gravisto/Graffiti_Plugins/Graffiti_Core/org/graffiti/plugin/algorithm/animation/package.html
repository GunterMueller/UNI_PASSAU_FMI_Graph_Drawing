Contains Gravisto's animation framework; i.e. interfaces and basic
implementations of algorithm animations. An animation is a stepwise
execution of a given agorithm
<tt>a</tt>
on a given graph
<tt>g</tt>
that visualizes these steps appropriately. We call
<tt>a</tt>
the
<i>underlying algorithm</i>
and
<tt>g</tt>
the
<i>underlying graph</i>
of the animation.
<p>We distinguish two basic types of Animations:
<ol>
	<li>Forward animations: i.e. animations that execute a given
	algorithm step by step but only in forward direction.</li>
	<li>Bidirectional animations: i.e. animations that execute a given
	algorithm step by step and allow stepping back to previous states of
	the algorithm.</li>
</ol>
This package provides implementations of both iteration logics. They're
called
<tt>ForwardAnimation</tt>
and
<tt>BidirectionalAnimation</tt>
respectively. Both implemetations use instances of interface
<tt>Step</tt>
to implement the behaviour specified by interface
<tt>Animation</tt>
.
<p>The recommended way of implementing a forward animation for a
given algorithm is to extend <tt>AbstractAnimation</tt> and implement <tt>hasNextStep</tt>
and <tt>nextStep</tt> using <tt>FowardAnimation</tt> as a delegate. A
bidirectional animation will subclass <tt>AbstractAnimation</tt> and
implement <tt>hasNextStep</tt>, <tt>nextStep</tt>, <tt>hasPreviousStep</tt>
and <tt>previousStep</tt> using <tt>BidirectionalAnimation</tt> as a
delegate.
<p>In either case you'll have to provide an instance of interface <tt>Step</tt>
to use <tt>ForwardAnimation</tt> or <tt>BidirectionalAnimation</tt>.
This instance will implement one step of the animation. For a given
algorithm of the form
<pre>
// initialize datastructures etc.
...
while (loopCondition) {
	loopBody();
}
// output result etc.
...
</pre>
a typical instance of
<tt>Step</tt>
will look as follows:
<tt>hasNext</tt>
will have something to do with the algorithm's loop condition, whereas
<tt>next</tt>
will perform one iteration of the loop body (perhaps performing some
output or visualization as well).
<p>These guidelines should apply to every instance implementing <tt>Step</tt>.
They will differ however in their implementations of <tt>undo</tt> and <tt>redo</tt>.
A step used by a forward animation does not have to implement neither <tt>undo</tt>
nor <tt>redo</tt>. Calls to the animation's <tt>previousStep</tt> method
should never occur, so there is no need to satisfy such requests.
However steps used by bidirectional animations must implement their <tt>undo</tt>
and <tt>redo</tt> methods, as <tt>BidirectionalAnimation</tt> relies on
those implementations to process calls to <tt>previousStep</tt> and <tt>nextStep</tt>.


<p>While an animation is being performed modifications to the
underlying graph may occur. A graph modification policy specifies the
animation's behaviour in case of nodes or edges being added or
removed or the underlying graph being cleared. Instances of <tt>Animation.GraphModificationPolicy</tt>
implement the graph modification policy of a given animation.
<p>The default policy implemented by <tt>AbstractAnimation</tt> is
to clear the animation on every modification of the underlying graph.
There are however other possibilities. An <i>online algorithm</i> could
allow additions and removals of nodes and edges by reacting appropriately to
such changes.
