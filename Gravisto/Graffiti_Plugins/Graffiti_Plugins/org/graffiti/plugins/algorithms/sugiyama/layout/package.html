<h3>Description</h3>
<p align="justify">
This package contains algorithms, that implement the final layout-phase in the
sugiyama-algorithm. They receive relative x- and y-coordinates from prior phases
stored in the object <i>NodeLayers</i> in <i>SugiyamaData</i> and have to
assign real x- and y-coordinates to the nodes.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Your implementation should not remove dummy-nodes from the graph, unless your
algorithm provides special methods to remove these dummy-nodes and re-design
their edges (e.g. use splines instead of bends).<br>
If you'd add bends instead of dummy-nodes, you don't have to remove the dummy-nodes.
The framework will take care of removing the dummy-nodes and adding bends to the
original edge.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Your implementation should not save the coordinates by directly manipulating
the <i>CoordinateAttribute</i> in the graphics-tree. You have to change or add
the <i>CoordinateAttribute</i> coordinate in the sugiyama attribute-tree. The
framework will take care of transferring these coordinates to the "real" coordinates
inside the graphics-tree.
</p>
<h3>Requirements and information for implementation</h3>
<p align="justify">
In general, your implementation should extend <i>AbstractAlgorithm</i>, to save
you some work and react to api-changes properly.
</p>
<p align="justify">
When you implement an algorithm for this phase, you have access to the object
<i>NodeLayers</i> in <i>SugiyamaData</i>. This object stores each layer/level of
the graph inside an <i>ArrayList</i>. The position of the nodes inside this
array-list represents their order on the current level. You don't have to access
attributes on the nodes to receive their order or level.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Your algorithm has to implement the following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Getter/Setter for SugiyamaData</b></li>
<li><b>getName()</b>: Return the name of your algorithm here - it is displayed
in the algorithm-chooser</li>
<li><b>check()</b>: Check if your algorithm can be applied to the current graph</li>
<li><b>execute()</b>: Do your work here - compute the coordinates and write them
into a <i>CoordinateAttribute</i> with the name "coordinate" inside the sugiyama
attribute-tree.</li>
<li><b>setDefaultParameters()</b>: Reset the parameters of your algorithm to
their default state.
</ul>
<h3>Optional</h3>
<p align="justify">
If it makes any sense for your algorithm, you can add support for animations to
your algorithm. Please refer to the documentation of Animation-Objects for further
information on how to support animations.<br>
If you do support animations, you have to return <tt>true</tt> in the method
<i>supportsAnimation()</i> inherited from <i>AbstractAlgorithm</i>.
