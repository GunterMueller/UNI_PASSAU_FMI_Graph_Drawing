<h3><a name="description">1. Description</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This package contains various helper-classes for the sugiyama-framework
</p>
<h3><a name="comparableclassparamter">2. ComparableClassParameter</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This class is used to sort the sugiyama-algorithms alphabeticall by their
<i>getName()</i>-method without losing the complete binary-name of the algorithms.
</p>
<h3><a name="coordinatesutil">3. CoordinatesUtil</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This class implements methods to manipulate the coordinates of a graph:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>updateRealCoordinates()</b> transfers the <i>CoordinateAttribute</i> of
the nodes that is stored in the sugiyama attribute-tree to the graphics-tree.</li>
<li><b>updateGraph()</b> re-paints the graph according to the current layout
of the object <i>NodeLayers</i>. First, a grid is computed for the graph, after
that, the nodes are aligned to that grid - by manipulating the <i>CoordinateAttribute</i>
in the graphics-tree.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="dummynodeutil">4. DummyNodeUtil</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This class contains methods to handle dummy-nodes in a graph:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>removeDummies()</b> removes all dummy-nodes from the graph. Instead of
the dummy-nodes, bends are added to the edges. The "first" edge in the path
between dummy-nodes is considered the original edge in the graph. This old, 
original edge will "grow" towards its original target in the process of this
method.</li>
<li><b>collectDummies()</b> iterates through all nodes in the graph and looks
for the attribute "isDummyNode" - as defined in SugiyamaConstants. These nodes
are added into <i>SugiyamaData</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="edgeutil">5. EdgeUtil</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This class contains methods to handle edges of the graph, especially bends
in these edges:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>reverseBendedEdges()</b> reverses edges that contain bends. If an edge
does contain bends, the collection of bends has to be inverted, otherwise the
bends would mess up the edge. This method is used in various implementations
of decycling-algorithms.</li>
<li><b>removeBends()</b> is called by the framework. In the sugiyama-algorithm,
the edges must not contain any bends. This method removes all bends from the
edges.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="findphasealgorithms">6. FindPhaseAlgorithms</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This class contains methods to search the classpath for implementations of
the sugiyama-interfaces and handle the results of this discovery:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>getPhaseAlgrithms()</b> transforms a HashMap, with the name of the phase as
key and the binary name of the implementing algorithm as value to an ArrayList of
String[]. In the returned ArrayList, the String[] at index i contains the
available algorithms for phase i-1, for 1<=i<=4.</li>
<li><b>getAlgorithms()</b> returns a HashMap with the four default algorithms
of sugiyama.</li>
<li><b>discoverAlgorithms()</b> searches the actual classpath for implementations
of sugiyama-interfaces. It returns a HashMap with the found algorithms and
stores found constraints in <i>SugiyamaData</i></li>
<li><b>displayNewComponents()</b> returns a HashSet of strings. These strings
are the binary names of new algorithms found during the last search. This
list gets displayed to the user when the search has finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="nodelayers">7. NodeLayers</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This data-structure represents the comlete layout of the graph. It is an
ArrayList of ArrayList of Node. The outer ArrayList represents the levels of
the graph, the inner ones the order of the nodes on the current level.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The levelling-phase decides which nodes are on which level (outer ArrayList),
but doesn't care about the order of the nodes on a level (in an inner ArrayList).
The crossmin-phase permutates the nodes on these levels. The layout-phase only
needs to access <i>NodeLayers</i> to have all he neccessary information about
the layout of the graph.
</p>
<h3><a name="#preferencesutil">8. PreferencesUtil</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This class provides methods to load and store preferences through Java.Preferences.
The sugiyama-framework saves, which algorithms are available in the classpath,
which constraints are available, and which algorithms have been chosen in 
the configuration-panel by the user:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>loadPreferences()</b> loads the sugiyama-preferences from the file-system
and stores the found data into <i>SugiyamaData</i>.</li>
<li><b>savePreferences()</b> saves the available algorithms and constraints, 
as well as the last selected algorithms into the filesystem</li>
<li><b>validateConstraints()</b> is used to check, if all the constraints that
had been available on a previous Gravisto-session are still available (i.e. the
classes are still present)</li>
<li><b>validateAlgorithms()</b> checks if all algorithms that had been available
on a previous Gravisto-session are still available.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="#sugiyamaconstants">9. SugiyamaConstants</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This interface contains all needed constants for the sugiyama-framework, like
paths in the attribute-tree or identifiers in the preferences.
</p>
<h3><a name="sugiyamadata">10. SugiyamaData</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
This bean is used by the individual phases to pass data from one to another. If
you have data that is needed by later phases, or you need data from a previous 
phase, you will find it in this object by using its getters or setters to access
the following objects:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>reversedEdges</b> contains all the edges that had been reversed by the
decycling-phase. If you implement the decycling-phase, you can put the reversed
edges here. EdgeUtil needs this object to contain all the reversed edges, if you
call it in your undo()-method</li>
<li><b>deletedEdges</b> contains all edges that the decycling-phase may have
been deleted. Please note that these edges will be inserted again after the
levelling-phase. If your decycling-algorithm deletes edges, it still has to
reverse edges in its undo()-method!</li>
<li><b>dummyNodes</b> contains all the dummy-nodes in the graph</li>
<li><b>layers</b> stores <i>NodeLayers</i> of the graph. Most phases will need
this!</li>
<li><b>startNode</b> holds the selected start-node (if there was a node selected
by the user). You should not have to worry about this</li>
<li><b>graph</b> contains the attached graph</li>
<li><b>phaseAlgorithms</b> stores all available algorithms for the framework</li>
<li><b>algorithmBinaryNames</b> is needed to create an instance of an algorithm. The
algorithms are displayed to the user by accessing their getName()-method</li>
<li><b>algorithms</b> are the algorithms that had been selected by the user</li>
<li><b>lastSelectedAlgorithms</b> are the algorithms thad had been selected
in a previous run of the sugiyama-algorithm</li>
<li><b>alternateLex</b> is used to toggle the method of comparing strings
lexicographically in the barycenter-algorithm</li>
<li><b>frameworkParameters</b> stores additional parameters that the framework
does support. The framework cannot return these in getParameters(), because
getParameters() influences the layout of the first page in the paramter-dialog.</li>
<li><b>animated</b> toggles support for framework-animation</li>
<li><b>constraints</b> holds the constraints that are attached to nodes in the graph</li>
<li><b>nodeMap</b> is a map to map a sugiyamaIdentifier to the actual node-object
in the graph</li>
<li><b>algorithMap</b> is used to cache instances of sugiyama-algorithms that
had been selected in previous runs of the framework</li>
<li><b>objects</b> is an all-purpose HashMap where the programmer can store aribtrary
data</li>
</ul>
