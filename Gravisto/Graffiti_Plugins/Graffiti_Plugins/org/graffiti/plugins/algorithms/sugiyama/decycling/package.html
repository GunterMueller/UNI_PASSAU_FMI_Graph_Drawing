This document contains a detailed description on howto write an algorithm for
the second phase in the sugiyama-algorithm - the <b>decycling</b>-phase.
</p>
<p align="justify">
You can either reverse edges that would create a circle, delete these edges
or do both. Please be aware of the following:<br>
If you delete edges, these edges <b>will be inserted after the levelling-phase</b>.
The framework will insert these edges again and it may need to reverse some of
these edges. So even if you only delete edges from the graph in your decycling-algorithm,
<b>you have to re-reverse</b> the edges that had been reversed by the framework.
These edges will be stored in <i>SugiyamaData.reversedEdges</i>.
</p>

<h3>Requirements (short)</h3>
<p align="justify">
This is a short list of what your algorithm has to implement:
<ul>
<li><b>getName()</b> The String that you return here will be displayed in the
algorithm-chooser</li>
<li><b>getData()/setData()</b></li>
<li><b>check()</b>: Check if your algorithm can handle the input-graph! Throw
a <b>PhasePreconditionException</b> and not a PreconditionException!</li>
<li><b>setDefaultParameters()</b>: Reset your Parameter[] to its default
state</li>
<li><b>execute()</b>: Decycle the graph in this method</li>
<li><b>Add hasBeenDecycled</b>: You have to add he <i>BooleanAttribute</i>
hasBeenDecycled into the sugiyama attribute-tree and set it to <b>true</b>
to inform the next phase about an acyclic graph.</li>
<li><b>undo()</b>: Undo your work - reset all the edges that you have reversed
or deleted to its initial state. Please note that the edges can contain bends!
You should use <i>EdgeUtil.reverseBendEdges()</i> to re-reverse edges.</li>
<li><b>reset()</b>: You have to reset your algorithm to its initial state, so it
can be run on different graphs without the need to create a new instance of the
algorithm.
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Optional</h3>
<p align="justify">
If it does make any sense to your algorithm, it can <b>support Animations</b>.
The framework will check if your algorithm supports animations. If it does, its
Animation-Object will be requested. Everything that would've been done in your
<i>execute()</i>-method has to be done in the Animation-Object.<br>
You can take a look at the <i>BaryCenter</i>-algorithm in the 
<i>crossMin</i>-package if you want to see how this can be implemented.
</p>
<h3>Requirements (detailled)</h3>
<p align="justify">
Your algorithm <b>has to implement the interface "DecyclingAlgorithm"</b>. If
you implement this interface, the sugiyama-framework will be able to detect
your algorithm by searching your classpath. You don't have to write any additional
plugin.xml-files to integrate your plugin into sugiyama - use the search-button
in the configuration-dialog to search for algorithms, and your implementation
should be found. <br><br>
Your algorithm has to implement support for the following sugiyama-specific methods:

<ul>
<li><b>getName()</b>: You have to implement the method <i>getName()</i> and
return the name of your algorithm. This String is displayed in the
configuration-dialog when the user selects the algorithms for each phase.</li>
<li><b>Getter and setter for the <i>SugiyamaData</i>-bean</b></li>
<li><b>check()</b>: You should run various tests on the attached graph before
trying to decycle the graph. The runs various test before executing, too, but
if you need the graph to have special properties, you have to check them for
yourself!<br>
Your algorithm <b>should not throw a PreconditionException</b> in <i>check()</i>
when you encounter errors. You have to throw a <b>PhasePreconditionException</b>
from the sugiyama-package instead.
</li>
<li><b>setDefaultParameters()</b>: If your algorithm uses Parameters, you have to
implement this method to restore its Parameters to a default state. The user
can click the "Default"-button in the configuration-dialog and expects that your
algorithm will reset its parameters to its original, default state.</li>
<li>Obviously, your algorithm has to implement the method <b>execute()</b>. Decycle
the graph in this method.</li>
<li><b>undo()</b>: Your algorithm has to implement the method <i>undo()</i>. After
the framework has finished calling all four phases of the sugiyama-algorithm, 
the edges that you have reversed or deleted from the graph to make it acyclic have
to be restored to their original state.<br>
If you reverse edeges in favour of deleting it, you can put them into 
<i>SugiyamaData</i>. When you implement <i>undo()</i>, it is
sufficient to call <b>EdgeUtil.reverseBendEdges()</b> with your 
<i>SugiyamaData</i> that contains the reversed edges.
<li>After you have decycled the graph, you have to add the <i>BooleanAttribute</i>
<b>hasBeenDecycled</b> into the sugiyama attribute-tree and <b>set it to true</b>, 
so the next phases can be sure that the graph is indeed acyclic.</li>
<li><b>reset()</b>: You have to reset your algorithm to its initial state, so it
can be run on different graphs without the need to create a new instance of the
algorithm.
</ul></p>
<p align="justify">
A short and simple decycling-algorithm can be found in the class <i>BFSDecycling</i>.
You can take a look at this class if you're stuck.<br>
If you want to take a look at a more sophisticated class, check out <i>DFSDecycling</i>.
It has support for various user-defined parameters.
