Graphlet Installation Instructions
==================================
				
The following document describes how to install the binary
distribution and the source code distribution of Graphlet.

   
Binary Distribution
-------------------

The binary distribution of Graphlet comes in a file named
   
    graphlet-version-state-compiler-os-release.tar.gz
     
This file is packed with the UNIX utilities tar and gzip.  To
unpack Graphlet, proceed as follows:
   
(1) Decompres: Type

    gunzip graphlet-version-state-compiler-os-release.tar.gz

  This will create a file named

    graphlet-version-state-compiler-os-release.tar

(2) Unpack: type
       
    tar xf graphlet-version-state-compiler-os-release.tar
    
  This will create a directory named

    graphlet-version-state-compiler-os-release

  You may rename this directory.
       
(3) Include the directory graphlet-version-state-compiler-os-release/bin
    in your path. To do this, execute
    
        PATH=path-to-graphlet/bin:$PATH
        export PATH

    to your shell profile if you are using sh, ksh or bash, and

        set path=(path-to-graphlet/bin $path)

    if you are using csh. You should add these lines to your
    startup file (e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bashprofile, ~/.cshrc).

(5) Optional: To use the graphscript shell in the binary
    distribution, you may need to set the environment variable
    GRAPHLE_DIR. To do this, execute
    
        GRAPHLET_DIR=path-to-graphlet
        export PATH

    to your shell profile if you are using sh, ksh or bash, and

        setenv GRAPHLET_DIR path-to-graphlet

    if you are using csh. You should add these lines to your
    startup file (e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bashprofile, ~/.cshrc.

Note: the path entered in step (4) is exactly $(GRAPHLET_DIR)/bin.

You can now start graphlet by typing

        graphlet

Have fun !

                                      
Source Code Distribution
------------------------

The source code distribution of Graphlet comes in a file named
   
    graphlet-version-state.tar.gz
     
This file is packed with the UNIX utilities tar and gzip. To
unpack Graphlet, proceed as follows:
   
(1) Decompress: Type
       
    gunzip graphlet-version-state.tar.gz

  This creates a directory named "graphlet-version-state.tar".
       
(2) Unpack: Type
       
    tar xf graphlet-version-state.tar

  This creates a directory named "graphlet-version-state".
       
(3) Go to the top level directory: Type
       
    cd graphlet-version-state

(4) Site specific configuration: Edit the file
       
    lib/graphlet/config/config

  and follow the instructions.
       
  NOTE: Never set the variable INSTALL_DIR to the
  directory where the source code resides. Otherwise, the
  installation will not run correctly.
       
(5) Configure, generate dependencies and compile: Type
       
    make allnew

  in the toplevel directory.
       
  NOTE: The make command must be GNU make. This might be called
  differently if your system is not UNIX based. Common names are
  gnumake and gmake. If in doubt, contact your local guru. The
  error message
     
    make: Fatal error: No arguments to build
     
  indicates that you are not using GNU make.
       
(6) Install: Type
       
    make install

  in the toplevel directory to install Graphlet into the directory
  specified as INSTALL_DIR in the GNUmakefile.

(7) OPTIONAL: Include Graphlet in your shell's PATH variable.
  Depending on your installation, you may need to include the directory
   
   $INSTALL_DIR/bin
     
  in your $PATH variable, where INSTALL_DIR is the installation
  directory given in step (7).

Installation is finished now. You start the graphlet graph editor
by typing

    graphlet

To start a graphscript shell, type

    graphscript
