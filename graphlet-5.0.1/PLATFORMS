                        Platforms and Required Software
                                       
Operating Systems

   We use Graphlet on the following operating systems:
   
   Solaris
   2.5, 2.4
   SunOS
   4.1.3
   Linux
   all
   Microsoft Windows
   95, NT
   
   We estimate that Graphlet can be ported to all platforms that are
   supported by Tcl/Tk and LEDA. Even if your configurations is not
   listed here, Graphlet might run without or with only a few
   modifications.
   
   Please notify us at graphlet@fmi.uni-passau.de if you succeed or fail
   to install Graphlet on a particular platform.
   
Required Software

   Graphlet is designed to be portable and should run on most systems
   without or with only few modifications. As a rule of thumb, the
   requiremed software to install Graphlet is
   
   UNIX Binaries
   X Window System
   Windows Binaries
   Tcl/Tk
   Source Code
   GNU zip
   GNU make
   SUN CC 4.1, GNU g+ 2.7.*
   Tcl 7.6 / Tk 4.2
   LEDA 3.4.*
   Documentation
   Postscript Printer, LaTeX2e
   
LEDA

   Graphlet needs LEDA version 3.4 or higher. Earlier version of LEDA
   cannot be supported because of bugs in LEDA. LEDA is available from
   MPI Saarbrücken, at http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/LEDA/leda.html.
   
   The binary distribution is statically linked with LEDA and does not
   require a separate LEDA installation.
   
Tcl/Tk

   Graphlet works with the following Tcl/Tk 7.6/4.2 or higher (alpha
   releases of Tcl/Tk 8 work according to our tests). Earlier versions
   will not work with the current releases. We recommend getting the
   latest releases.
   
   Tcl/Tk is available from from Sun Microsystems Laboratories at
   http://www.sunlabs.com:80/research/tcl.
   
   The binary distribution for UNIX is statically linked with Tcl/Tk and
   does not require a separate Tcl/Tk installation. The Windows version
   needs a separate Tcl/Tk installation for technical purposes.
   
Perl

   perl release 5 is required for some optional tools included with
   Graphlet. If you plan to develop Graphlet modules, we recommend using
   perl instead of tools like awk and sed. Graphlet's Coding Standards
   even require that. We chose this approach since perl scripts are much
   more portable than awk or sed scripts. In any case, the source code
   distribution will always compile without perl.
   
   Perl is available from http://www.perl.com.
   
Disk space

   Currently, the installed system requires about 5-10 Mb disk space. The
   source code distribution needs about 20-30 Mb for the compilation.
   Future versions will likely require more space.
