			    GRAPHLET

The Graphlet System is a toolkit for graph editors and graph
(layout) algorithms. Graphlet consists of three major components:

- The graphscript interpreter.
  Graphscript is a programming language for graphs that is based
  on Tcl/Tk and LEDA. Graphscript provides all operations that are
  neccessary to manipulate and display graphs, and supports the GML
  file format.  

- The graphlet graph editor
  The graphlet editor is the heart of the Graphlet system, and is
  implemented in Graphscript. The editor is highly customizable, and
  can be extended in Graphscript.
 
- Graph layout algorithms
  Graphlet comes with a set of layout algorithms, several algorithms
  for spring embedders, directed acyclic graphs and trees.

Graphlet has been ported to Solaris, SunOS, Linux and Windows
95/NT platforms, and is available free of charge for
non-commercial applications from
