LEDA-SGRAPH Interface
=====================

This is the first version of the LEDA-Sgraph interface. It
contains the LSD interface, several graph layout algorithms and a
sample program in lsd/main.cc

To use this software, edit lsd/makefile, GA/Makefile and
sgraph/Makefile. Hint: the Makefiles are set up for solaris
(2.4).

To compile, just type "make". This will create a program "lsd" in
the lsd subdirectory.

Note: The makefiles in this version are somewhat chaotic. We will
try to redo them in the future.

What is what ?
--------------

lsd			LEDA-Sgraph Interface, supports calls of Sgraph modules from LEDA.
GA			GA interface (LEDA/GraphEd FileFormat)
Sgraph		Standalone sgraph library
contrib/*	GraphEd algorithm clones (e.g. tunkelang, springembedder_rf)
graphed		GraphEd header file stubs
xview		xview header file stubs

To add more algorithms (or extract a particular one), look at and
modify lsd/main.cc.

Note: The modules in contrib/* should also run without LEDA as
standalone Sgraph applications.
