What you should send us

   Description
          Give a description of the bug. If possible, tell us how we can
          reproduce the bug. "Graphlet sometimes chrashes" without any
          further information will not help us much.
          
   Operating System
          We need your operating system, as some bugs occur only with
          specific operating systems. Please Include the version number
          of the operating system if possible.
          
   Graphlet Version
          Please include the version number of Graphlet. Without this
          information, we may not be able to reproduce the bug correctly.
          
   Tcl/Tk and LEDA versions
          If possible, include the version numbers of Tcl/Tk and LEDA.
          You can get the version number of Tcl from graphscript:
          

  prompt> graphscript
  & info tclversion
  7.5
  Control-D

   Since the version numbers of Tcl and Tk are tightly coupled, the Tcl
          version is sufficent. Question to the reader: is there a easy
          way to find the version number of LEDA ?

For Installation Problems ...

   Include the output of make
          It is often a good idea to include the output of make.
          
   Include the configuration files
          Send us the file lib/graphlet/config/config. If you modified
          other files in the directory lib/graphlet/config, please
          include them.
          
   Version numbers
          As always, is useful to include the version number of the
          program that failed. E.g. if make reports a syntax error, it
          might be helpful for us to know the version number of make.

For Runtime Errors ...

   Tcl Runtime Errors
          If graphlet reports a tcl error, please return the full tcl
          error message. Tcl's error messages are a complete stack trace
          and give very precise idea what goes wrong.
          
   Crashes
          If graphlet crashes, try to give a precise description. If you
          have a specific graph which causes a crash, send it. If you
          have a stack trace from a debugger, send it.

Thanks

   I know we are asking for a lot, but the more information we get, the
   better we will be able to track down your problem.
