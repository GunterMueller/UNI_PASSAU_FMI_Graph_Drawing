[ Subgraphs ] 
  
  RATIONALE: Many algorithms work only on part of a graph. A subgraph is
  a convenient way of refering to a part of a graph. The nodes and the
  edges in the subgraph must be the same as in the origninal graph. The
  same behaviour can be achieved through hiding nodes and edges in a
  graph, but then only one subgraph is possible.
  
  STATUS: open 


[ Genric Attributes ]

  RATIONALE: Graphs with additional attributes for nodes and edges. This
  is possible by making a sub-class of graph and keeping a node_map and
  edge_map of appropriate type therein. This process of subclassing
  should be automated a generic graph class with template parameters.

  STATUS: open


[ DFS Iterators ]

  RATIONALE: Iterator based variants of common algorithms.

  STATUS: in progress 


[ GraphML Support ]

  RATIONALE: GraphML seems to be the upcoming standard for saving
  graphs. However, support for GML should be kept up for a while as
  well. Alternativly we could provide converters for GML to GraphML.

  STATUS: open


[ Graph Generator ]
  
  RATIONALE: In many applications random graph are needed for
  testing. Graph Generators for general graphs as well as for special
  graph classes (connected, biconnected, planar, etc.) are needed.

[ Download Form ]

  RATIONALE: At the moment everyone sends a mail with unspecified
  format to gtl_download. This should be standardized.

[ Doxygen ] 

  RATIONALE: Doxygen is way better supported and documented than
  KDoc. Furthermore it has more features (graphs ...).
