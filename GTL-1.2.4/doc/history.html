        <ul>
          <li> Added two max-flow algorithms implemented by <a href="http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~bachmaie/">Christian Bachmaier</a> 
            See the manual for details.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>0.3.0
        <ul> 
          <li> <em>graph:</em> added new constructor to create an isomorphic 
            induced subgraph</li>
          <li> <em>biconnectivity:</em> added option to make an arbitrary 
            graph biconnected. Added accessor function for the additional
            edges. </li>
          <li> <em>planarity:</em> fixed bug in pq-tree (the labels of direction
            indicators were not cleared correctly after a reduction) </li>
          <li> <em>planarity:</em> added switches for embedding, kuratowski graphs 
            and for using the new make_biconnected of biconnectivity test.</li>
          <li> <em>planarity</em> changed the strategy for finding the pertinent 
            leaves in reduction. </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>0.2.6
        <ul>
          <li> One nasty bug in planarity test fixed, which made
            the test crash in a lot of cases. </li>
          <li> Fixed bug in biconnectivity algorithm: The edges
            in a biconnected component were not correctly
            detected.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>0.2.5
	<ul>
          <li> Added detection of subgraphs homeomorphic to either K5 or 
            K3,3 in case that the graph is not planar.</li>
          <li> Added support for graphs with multiple edges and selfloops
            in planarity test.</li>
          <li> fixed some bugs in planarity test.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>0.2.4
	<ul>
          <li> several bugfixes in planarity-test; especially in the embedding part.</li>
          <li> made hide/restore of nodes and edges more efficient.</li>
          <li> planarity-test for graphs which are not biconnected now runs
            in O(n), too; this was achieved by a more efficient strategy
            for hiding and restoring biconnected components. </li>
          <li> redisigned homepage.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>0.2.3
	<ul>
	  <li> Windows compatibility: now everything can be used on Windows 
	    platforms, too. Especially the planarity test now works on
	    windows.</li>
	  <li> Bug fixes: 
	    <ul>
	      <li> planarity test: fixed some rather nasty bugs</li>
	      <li> symmetric list bug: So far only occurred in planarity
		test and is fixed now.</li>
	  </ul></li>
	  <li> Some more documentation (it still is rather poor,but
	    who needs a manual when he has the header files ;-)</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li>0.2.2
	<ul>
	  <li> Again bug fixes.</li>
      </ul></li>
      
      <li>0.2.1
	<ul>
	  <li>Minor bug fixes, especially in the GML support and in
	    some algorithms.</li>
	  <li>More algorithms:
	    <ul>
	      <li>st-numbering,</li>
	      <li> planarity test (ALPHA !!)</li>
	  </ul></li>
	  <li>Data structures added:
	    <ul>
	      <li>pq-trees (needed for planarity testing, at the moment
		tailored to that purpose, but will become a template
		class)</li>
	      <li>planar embedding.</li>
	      <li>symmetric list; very much like the STL class list,
		but can be reversed in constant time</li>
	  </ul></li>
      </ul></li>

      <li>0.2.0
	<ul>
	  <li>Removed all deprecated classes and methods.</li>
	  <li>Introduced new algorithm concept. The basic algorithms like DFS
	    and BFS are no longer implemented as member functions of the graph
	    class for the following reasons:
	    <ul>
	      <li>These algorithms have a lot of options and
		variations which can hardly be handled in only *one*
		function call.</li> 
	      <li> All the algorithms produce some data which has to
		stored and handled efficiently. Since the data belongs
		inherently to the algorithms thought it a good idea to
		tie it somehow to the algorithm itself.</li>
	      <li>Some algorithms are small extensions of others,
		e.g. the biconnectivity test adds only a few lines to
		the standard DFS algorithm.</li>
	    </ul>
	    Thus we thought it would be a good solution to make all
	    algorithms classes, which are derived from one base class
	    implementing the interface common to all
	    algorithm.</li>
	  <li>Added <a href="http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet">GML</a>
	    support.
	    <a href="http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet">GML</a>  is
	    a very flexible description language we use as file format
	    for our graphs</li>
      </ul></li>
      
      <li>0.1.0
	Please note that this is a very early alpha release of GTL. It probably
	contains many bugs and its interfaces may change in details. Especially
	the classes and methods declared as 'deprecated' are likely to be removed
	for the final version.</li>
